Q: Define the internal resistance of a source
A: The internal resistance is a modeling concept that accounts for the fact that when a current is drawn from an emf its voltage drops. Usually in circuits the load resistance is much larger than the source resistance. However, maximum power transfer from source to load occurs when the load resistance is equal to the source resistance. (at this situation, though only half the power drawn from the source goes to the load with the other half being consumed as heat in the battery's source resistance)
 
Q: Describe the effect of temperature in the conduction of metals and semiconductors
A: In metals as temperature rises so does the vibration of atoms and this makes the flow of electrons harder which reduces conductivity (or increases resistivity). In semiconductors where conduction electrons are freed from atoms there are more such electrons freed as the temperature rises and this causes conductivity to increase with temperature (or resistivity to decrease with temperature - eg  thermistor)

Q: Explain what observations lead to the discovery of the particle nature of light
A: The fact that light above a certain minimum frequency only could release photoelectrons from a certain metal could not be explained by the wave nature of light and this lead to the quantum theory of light which states that light energy comes in quanta known as photons each of which has an energy equal to  h.f
 
Q: Why does conventional wave theory fail to explain the photoelectric effect?
A: If light is a wave then a large enough amplitude for any given frequency should carry enough energy to cause the release of photoelectrons. Again a wave would accumulate enough energy over time to cause the release of photoelectrons. Neither actually is true and this lead Einstein to porpose the particle theory of light .

Q: What is an emission spectrum ?
A: It is the set of coloured lines (specific frequencies) against a black background that corresponds to specific energy transitions of electrons in excited atoms.

Between the ground state and the ionization state where electrons are have escaped from the atom there are various intermediate but distinct energy states. When electrons are raised to these intermediate states they will fall to lower states and eventually to the ground state giving off photons of specific frequencies that correspond to the specific transitions.
 
Q: defination or define or What is laser light ?
A: Laser light is light that is the result of simultaneous energy transitions by a very large number of atoms. This makes all photons to be in phase and cause a coherent emission which makes laser light so strong.  In ordinary light photons are not in phase in laser light they are in phase.
